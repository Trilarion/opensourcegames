Free Abuse, is a liberated version of a 1995 shareware game Abuse.
Abuse was mostly released into public domain, with the exception of music, sounds effects and data exclusive to the commercial (registered) version,
which included all levels above 4. To fill in the missing pieces, fRaBs project was started.
