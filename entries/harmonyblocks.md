A calm, browser-based “falling-block” puzzle designed to promote focus and relaxation.  
Shapes drift downward and the player gently aligns them with faint outlines at the bottom of the screen.  
Soft gradients, blues & greens, adaptive speed and purely positive feedback keep stress low and encourage short mindful breaks.
