This is an engine recreation of a Pac-Man clone called Greedy by French demogroup Eclipse. Originally written for DOS and sold as shareware, Greedy was later ported to Windows and eventually made a free, but not open source game. Open Greedy attempts to recreate the game's engine for proper cross-platform compatibility.
