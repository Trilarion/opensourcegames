## Building

Uses its own Build process

2017-11 (1.65.1)
- Much is header only, but some parts require building
- Follow [Getting started on Windows](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_65_1/more/getting_started/windows.html) or [Getting started on Unix variants](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_65_1/more/getting_started/unix-variants.html)
- Building on Windows with MSVC 2017 requires a workaround (see [issue #13197](https://svn.boost.org/trac10/ticket/13197))
- With MSVC 2015 run "bootstrap vc14" followed by "b2 toolset=msvc-14.0 stage"
